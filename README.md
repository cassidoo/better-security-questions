# Better Security Questions ðŸ”’

Security questions are pretty boring and stereotypical (like, "what's your mother's maiden name?" and "on what street did you grow up?") which are fine, but... predictable and unsafe.

This is a package of better security questions to make the world safer for eeeeeveryone!

## To install

```bash
npm install better-security-questions
```

## To use

```js
const securityQuestions = require('better-security-questions');

securityQuestions.silly;
> ["Are you even good enough to have imposter syndrome?", ...

securityQuestions.random('silly');
> "When did you stop trying?"
```

## To contribute

Please add questions that you think would be good! Answers to them should be:

- Memorable (it should pop in the user's head right away)
- Unique (there should be one precise answer for the user)
- Unpredictable (something others can't easily guess or research)
- Consistent (it shouldn't change over time)

Remember to add your question following the alphabetical order!
